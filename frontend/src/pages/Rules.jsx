                        <p>The goal of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot
                            make a
                            move.</p>

                        <h3>Starting Setup</h3>
                        <p>Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the black squares of the first three rows on
                            their side of
                            the

                        <p>Players take turns. Pieces can only move diagonally one square forward to an empty black
                            square.</p>

                        <h3>Capturing Pieces</h3>
                        <p>If an opponent's piece is on a neighboring diagonal square, and there is an empty square
                            behind it, the
                            piece
                            can
                            jump over the opponent's piece and land on the empty square, removing the opponent's piece
                            from the
                            board.

                        <h3>Becoming a King</h3>
                        <p>When a piece reaches the last row on the opposite side of the board, it becomes a king. A
                            king can move
                            diagonally forward and backward any number of squares.

                            cannot make a
                            move.
